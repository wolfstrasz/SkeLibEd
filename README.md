# PSLED / SkeLibED

Parallel Skeleton Library (University of Edinburgh)

## Patterns:
* Parallel Map (Map). With static (before execution) workload distribution.
* Parallel Map (DynamicMap7). Workload is of different size and it is allocated to threads dynamically.
* Reduce
* Map Reduce
* Scan
* Parallel Stencil/ Map Overlay (under construction atm)

## Test suite:
* Mandelbrot set
* Nbody simulation
* Collatz conjecture

## Test machines
* 4-Core DICE machine
* 40-Core DICE server
